# PostgreSQL
## Introduction
PostgreSQL is a relational database system. It is used to store information and data, using the language SQL.</br>
This tool belongs to the `Blue Team` section.

## Implementation
The implementation of this tool in Ansible is as follows:
1. PostgreSQL is installed and configured on the specified host
2. A dedicated user and group are used to run PostgreSQL. They are automatically configured when installing the package
3. There are different modules that can be loaded:
    - User creation
    - Database creation
    - SSL implementation
    - Oauth implementation (for future implementations, not available)
    - WAL and replica implementation

## Usage
1. Run the playbook (instructions can be found [here](../../../../roles/postgresql/README.md))
2. After the installation and configuration, you will have access to the database!
